# Kubernetes-Project-01
I maked this repo studyng with alura, here we are going to create 3 pods, 3 services and 3 configmaps.
I hope you enjoy c:

Instructions:
-> 1 - kubectl apply -f <arquives>
-> 2 - in noticias-configmap.yaml you need to put your own IP, in this case with linux you will use the node IP.(you can see IP nodes with "kubectl get nodes -o wide").

#This project was maked with minikube!
